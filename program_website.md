The depleted mantle is a principal component of the upper mantle and drives significant volcanism. However, our knowledge of the depleted mantle has remained limited due to its severely restricted accessibility, with only local exposure of abyssal peridotites along slow- and ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridges and transform faults. Although abyssal peridotites have yielded important insights into mantle composition and melting, the vast majority of these rocks have been obtained by dredging. Hence, they lack the context, spatial continuity, and orientation information critical for understanding a range of processes, including the spatial scale of compositional variations, melt migration and mantle flow. As a result, many properties of the depleted mantle have been inferred from the study of its melting products: mid-ocean ridge basalts. 

Here, we report the recovery of a long (1268 m) section of serpentinized abyssal mantle peridotite, interleaved with thin gabbroic intrusions, from Atlantis Massif (Mid-Atlantic Ridge) during IODP Expedition 399. The nearly continuous recovery in the principal hole (U1601C) provides an opportunity to obtain a robust and quantitative lithological, mineralogical, and structural inventory of the upper mantle. 

The peridotites are dominated by harzburgite (82%; Fig. 1), with significant dunite (18%); lherzolite is rare, as are ultramafic veins (wehrlite, orthopyroxenite, (olivine) websterite). Mineralogically and geochemically, the peridotites are depleted: harzburgites have low orthopyroxene content (average 15.9%) and often lack clinopyroxene altogether. Geochemically, the peridotites have high MgO/SiO2 and low Al2O3/SiO2, falling on the depleted end of the array defined by global mantle rocks.

Orthopyroxene abundance varies significantly on scales ranging from the centimeter to hundreds of meters, forming a continuum from 0-30%. Dunite occurs as zones in harzburgite and, more frequently, in orthopyroxene-bearing dunite, and are typically tens of centimeters thick. Contacts between dunite and the surrounding peridotites are nearly always gradational, and well-defined dunite zones are an endmember of a continuum of variations in orthopyroxene content in the mantle rocks, with the full spectrum of harzburgite to dunite preserved in the core. We posit that the observed variations in mineralogy and therefore lithology are controlled by melt migration and the associated dissolution of orthopyroxene and precipitation of olivine, superimposed on the residues of relatively high degrees of melting.

The geometry of melt flow is captured by the orientation of the dunite zones. Harzburgite-dunite contacts have predominantly intermediate dips and record a ~40° discordance with the mantle fabrics. This is consistent with the formation of a network of dunite channels with variable but predominantly intermediate dips oblique to mantle upwelling as a result of melt focusing toward the ridge axis.

Going forward, the comprehensive rock record obtained during Expedition 399 provides a wealth of opportunities to make fundamental advances on our understanding of the oceanic upper mantle. This includes a determination of mantle heterogeneity on the centimeter to kilometer scale and investigations of the role of previous depletion in governing mantle composition and melting. The continuous nature of the core, and its re-orientation, will also be instrumental in studies of spatial variations in melting and melt transport, as well as research into mantle flow and the associated deformation mechanisms.

The Oman ophiolite provides direct sampling access to a complete sequence of oceanic lithosphere formed in a fast-spreading ridge environment. Our research aims at constraining processes ruling lithosphere accretion, by studying the composite recrystallization and melt migration history recorded in the Oman lithospheric mantle. Such evolution of magmatic and metamorphic processes occurring within the mantle from spinel- to plagioclase-facies conditions are poorly constrained to date, despite numerous studies devoted to the Moho Transition Zone (MTZ) and the oceanic crust.

Here, we present microstructural and petrological evidence of reactive melt percolation that occurred in the Oman mantle harzburgites at spinel-facies conditions.

The studied samples pertain to the upper mantle section of the Wadi Tayin massif. They were selected according to their textural features and depth from the MTZ, to observe possible variations in the modes and extent of the reactive melt percolation process as a function of depth in the mantle. The entire sample set was collected by our research team during the OmanDP core logging of the CM (Crust-Mantle transition) Sites (2017- 2018; Kelemen et al., 2020) and a field campaign along the Wadi Nassif (February 2024). The latter allowed sampling of the shallow harzburgitic mantle down to ~800 m below the MTZ, and better documenting the macro- to micro-scale distribution and interplays between melt transport and shallow mantle deformation at the crust-mantle interface. 

The studied harzburgites display a porphyroclastic association of Ol+Opx± Cpx±Spl and a weak mantle foliation defined by the elongation and alignment of orthopyroxene and/or spinel grains. Opx porphyroclasts show diffuse Cpx exsolutions and are partially to completely replaced by granoblastic aggregates composed of Opx+Cpx±Spl.  The granoblastic association is formed by the progressive cooling of the harzburgite at subsolidus lithospheric conditions (T= 950–1050 °C as determined by Opx – Cpx geothermometers). Both pyroxene porphyroclasts and granoblasts show lobate contacts with interstitial olivine crystals, suggesting reactive melt percolation that involved pyroxene dissolution and crystallization of new olivine from the migrating melt. Different pyroxene generations (porphyroclastic and granoblastic) exhibit similar major element compositions. 

Crystallographic Preferred Orientations (CPO) of orthopyroxene show patterns characteristic of upper mantle deformation under high-T and dry conditions. In contrast, the olivine CPO varies from axial-[100] patterns, coherent with olivine from upper mantle peridotite deformed under high T and dry conditions (Tommasi et al., 2000), to axial-[010] patterns, indicating deformation in the presence of melt (Zimmerman et al., 1999). Such CPO transition is correlated with olivine modal contents increasing from 65% to 80%. Harzburgites with lower modal olivine contents show weak axial-[100] olivine CPO, whereas samples with higher modal olivine abundances have well-defined axial-[010] olivine CPO. Harzburgite modal composition and CPO evolution are interpreted as being controlled by the melt-rock ratio integrated over time similar to what proposed by (Higgie & Tommasi, 2012) for the MTZ. Harzburgites preserving lower olivine modal amount and axial-[100] CPO record lower melt-rock ratio over time compared to those characterized by stronger axial-[010] CPO symmetry and high olivine modal contents.

This study suggests that reactive melt percolation affected the Oman mantle at spinel-facies conditions, after melting and subsequent incorporation at lithospheric environment by conductive cooling. Such event, although not causing evident changes in mineral major element compositions, is clearly documented by modal and microstructural evolution of spinel harzburgites. This evolution reflects microscale variations in melt/rock ratios and indicates percolation of melts across the uppermost ~800m of mantle section, with no direct correlation with depth from the Moho Transition Zone.

Oceanic spreading is one of the core processes of modern plate tectonics. In oceanic spreading centers, the melts formed by asthenosphere decompression upwelling can migrate quickly into oceanic crust through focused channels (Xiong et al., 2022). However, the existed dunitic channel model is mainly built based on investigations of the Oman ophiolite produced in fast spreading centers. Researchers have few knowledges on how dunitic channels formed in slow-ultraslow spreading centers. In this study, we selected the Dazhuka ophiolite, a product formed in oceanic slow-ultraslow spreading centers (Wang et al., 2024), to reveal the formation mechanism of dunitic channels. Through detailed petrographic observations and geochemical analyses, we found that these dunites can be divided as three types, Type 1 dunite, Type 2 dunite and Type 3A/3B dunite. The three types of dunites have relationships in petrogenesis. 1) From Type 1 to Type 2 dunites, the content of orthopyroxene (Opx) is gradually decreasing until Opx is all consumed, while the diameter of olivine (Ol) is gradually growing up to 2-3 cm. In addition to this, geochemical evidence also shows gradually increasing of Mg#-whole rock (0.91-0.93), Cr#-spinel (Spl; 0.46-0.83) and LREE/HREE-clinopyroxene (Cpx, 0.08-1.42). These phenomena may indicate reaction between wall-rock harzburgites and silica-unsaturated melts. 2) From Type 2 to Type 3A/3B dunite, Mg#-whole rock (0.93-0.87), Cr#-Spl (0.83-0.24), and LREE/HREE-Cpx (1.42-0.02) are decreasing, which may be caused by interaction between Type 2 dunites and silica-saturation melts. 3) The three types of dunites all exhibit amphibole growing around Cpx, and enrichment of fluid mobile elements of two kinds of pyroxenes, implying that later volatile-rich melts or fluids metasomatized these dunites.

Based on these lines of evidence, we suggest that the formation processes of the multiple types of Dazhuka dunites reveal unique dynamic characteristics of asthenosphere upwelling beneath oceanic slow-ultraslow spreading centers. In the first stage, silica-unsaturated melts were formed by stronger asthenospheric upwelling and reacted with wall-rock harzburgites to gradually formed Type 1 and Type 2 dunites. In the second stage, the upwelling of asthenosphere with the dunitic channels became weaker, ambient silica-saturated melts were focused into the dunitic channels and reacted with Type 2 dunites to form Type 3A/3B dunites. Eventually, when the dunitic channels became a part of the lithospheric mantle, the asthenospheric upwelling almost stagnated and formed volatile-rich melts or fluids to metasomatize the dunitic channels within the lithosphere. This study thus shows that asthenospheric upwelling may be pulsed under oceanic slow-ultraslow spreading center.

Kimberlites give an exceptional insight of the deep cratonic mantle by exhuming at an extreme pace well-preserved peridotites from a wide range of depths. The fast exhumation velocity of peridotite limits diffusion of incompatible trace elements (REE, hydrogen) due to the interaction between the ascending kimberlite melt and the rock and allows to measure pristine water contents in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs). Water is regarded as a key parameter as it may impact, depending on its concentration, physical parameters such as rheology and partial melting. This study is focused on the petrology and water quantification of 17 spinel and garnet harzburgites scattered over a wide range of pressure (25 to 51 kbar) from Jagersfontein mine located at the rim of the Kaapvaal craton. Sampling was focused on poorly metasomatized, ultra-refractory harzburgites (Fo92-95) which are considered to represent the most preserved cratonic archean mantle. Water content was obtained from FTIR spectroscopy on the most representative phases: olivine, orthopyroxexe, clinopyroxene and garnet. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between petrology, water content of non-metasomatized cratonic mantle.

The observed nanochannels are found parallel to [001] along the clinopyroxene-amphibole interface, particularly where an even number of clinopyroxene I beams transform to an odd number of amphibole I beams (**Fig. 1**; Veblen and Buseck, 1981). All nanochannels have slightly asymmetrical, edge-like shape in the [010] direction from the clinopyroxene towards the amphibole, associated with an additional pyribole phase in the [100] direction towards the clinopyroxene (**Fig. 1**). The pyribole is most likely the result of stress relaxation finalizing the shapes of the nanochannels.

​      The major and trace element composition of rock-forming minerals of upper mantle xenoliths from the Persani Mountains volcanic area show that the upper mantle went through significant degree of hydrous metasomatism (Vaselli et al., 1995; Falus et al., 2008; Faccini et al., 2020; Lange et al., 2023). Fraction of the infiltrating H2O-bearing supercritical fluid was trapped in fluid inclusions hosted by olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene (Lange et al., 2023). In clinopyroxene, some fluid inclusions are associated with amphibole, which is the reaction product of the host clinopyroxene and the entrapped H2O-bearing fluid (Lange et al., 2023), based on petrographical observation. The presence of these channels implies higher diffusion velocity due to the relatively large "void" volume compared to other structural distortions along the clinopyroxene-amphibole phase boundary.

In our study, we use quantum mechanical simulations to explore the physical properties and effects of the clinopyroxene-amphibole interface that ensure the rapid element diffusion. The obtained results help us to better understand the formation and growth of nominally ‘water’-bearing minerals in deep lithospheric settings (lower crust, upper mantle) and the driving forces for significant fluid composition changes during micron- to nanoscale fluid evolution.
