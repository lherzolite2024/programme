The depleted mantle is a principal component of the upper mantle and drives significant volcanism. However, our knowledge of the depleted mantle has remained limited due to its severely restricted accessibility, with only local exposure of abyssal peridotites along slow- and ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridges and transform faults. Although abyssal peridotites have yielded important insights into mantle composition and melting, the vast majority of these rocks have been obtained by dredging. Hence, they lack the context, spatial continuity, and orientation information critical for understanding a range of processes, including the spatial scale of compositional variations, melt migration and mantle flow. As a result, many properties of the depleted mantle have been inferred from the study of its melting products: mid-ocean ridge basalts. 

Here, we report the recovery of a long (1268 m) section of serpentinized abyssal mantle peridotite, interleaved with thin gabbroic intrusions, from Atlantis Massif (Mid-Atlantic Ridge) during IODP Expedition 399. The nearly continuous recovery in the principal hole (U1601C) provides an opportunity to obtain a robust and quantitative lithological, mineralogical, and structural inventory of the upper mantle. 

The peridotites are dominated by harzburgite (82%; Fig. 1), with significant dunite (18%); lherzolite is rare, as are ultramafic veins (wehrlite, orthopyroxenite, (olivine) websterite). Mineralogically and geochemically, the peridotites are depleted: harzburgites have low orthopyroxene content (average 15.9%) and often lack clinopyroxene altogether. Geochemically, the peridotites have high MgO/SiO2 and low Al2O3/SiO2, falling on the depleted end of the array defined by global mantle rocks.

Orthopyroxene abundance varies significantly on scales ranging from the centimeter to hundreds of meters, forming a continuum from 0-30%. Dunite occurs as zones in harzburgite and, more frequently, in orthopyroxene-bearing dunite, and are typically tens of centimeters thick. Contacts between dunite and the surrounding peridotites are nearly always gradational, and well-defined dunite zones are an endmember of a continuum of variations in orthopyroxene content in the mantle rocks, with the full spectrum of harzburgite to dunite preserved in the core. We posit that the observed variations in mineralogy and therefore lithology are controlled by melt migration and the associated dissolution of orthopyroxene and precipitation of olivine, superimposed on the residues of relatively high degrees of melting.

The geometry of melt flow is captured by the orientation of the dunite zones. Harzburgite-dunite contacts have predominantly intermediate dips and record a ~40° discordance with the mantle fabrics. This is consistent with the formation of a network of dunite channels with variable but predominantly intermediate dips oblique to mantle upwelling as a result of melt focusing toward the ridge axis.

Going forward, the comprehensive rock record obtained during Expedition 399 provides a wealth of opportunities to make fundamental advances on our understanding of the oceanic upper mantle. This includes a determination of mantle heterogeneity on the centimeter to kilometer scale and investigations of the role of previous depletion in governing mantle composition and melting. The continuous nature of the core, and its re-orientation, will also be instrumental in studies of spatial variations in melting and melt transport, as well as research into mantle flow and the associated deformation mechanisms.

The Oman ophiolite provides direct sampling access to a complete sequence of oceanic lithosphere formed in a fast-spreading ridge environment. Our research aims at constraining processes ruling lithosphere accretion, by studying the composite recrystallization and melt migration history recorded in the Oman lithospheric mantle. Such evolution of magmatic and metamorphic processes occurring within the mantle from spinel- to plagioclase-facies conditions are poorly constrained to date, despite numerous studies devoted to the Moho Transition Zone (MTZ) and the oceanic crust.

Here, we present microstructural and petrological evidence of reactive melt percolation that occurred in the Oman mantle harzburgites at spinel-facies conditions.

The studied samples pertain to the upper mantle section of the Wadi Tayin massif. They were selected according to their textural features and depth from the MTZ, to observe possible variations in the modes and extent of the reactive melt percolation process as a function of depth in the mantle. The entire sample set was collected by our research team during the OmanDP core logging of the CM (Crust-Mantle transition) Sites (2017- 2018; Kelemen et al., 2020) and a field campaign along the Wadi Nassif (February 2024). The latter allowed sampling of the shallow harzburgitic mantle down to ~800 m below the MTZ, and better documenting the macro- to micro-scale distribution and interplays between melt transport and shallow mantle deformation at the crust-mantle interface. 

The studied harzburgites display a porphyroclastic association of Ol+Opx± Cpx±Spl and a weak mantle foliation defined by the elongation and alignment of orthopyroxene and/or spinel grains. Opx porphyroclasts show diffuse Cpx exsolutions and are partially to completely replaced by granoblastic aggregates composed of Opx+Cpx±Spl.  The granoblastic association is formed by the progressive cooling of the harzburgite at subsolidus lithospheric conditions (T= 950–1050 °C as determined by Opx – Cpx geothermometers). Both pyroxene porphyroclasts and granoblasts show lobate contacts with interstitial olivine crystals, suggesting reactive melt percolation that involved pyroxene dissolution and crystallization of new olivine from the migrating melt. Different pyroxene generations (porphyroclastic and granoblastic) exhibit similar major element compositions. 

Crystallographic Preferred Orientations (CPO) of orthopyroxene show patterns characteristic of upper mantle deformation under high-T and dry conditions. In contrast, the olivine CPO varies from axial-[100] patterns, coherent with olivine from upper mantle peridotite deformed under high T and dry conditions (Tommasi et al., 2000), to axial-[010] patterns, indicating deformation in the presence of melt (Zimmerman et al., 1999). Such CPO transition is correlated with olivine modal contents increasing from 65% to 80%. Harzburgites with lower modal olivine contents show weak axial-[100] olivine CPO, whereas samples with higher modal olivine abundances have well-defined axial-[010] olivine CPO. Harzburgite modal composition and CPO evolution are interpreted as being controlled by the melt-rock ratio integrated over time similar to what proposed by (Higgie & Tommasi, 2012) for the MTZ. Harzburgites preserving lower olivine modal amount and axial-[100] CPO record lower melt-rock ratio over time compared to those characterized by stronger axial-[010] CPO symmetry and high olivine modal contents.

This study suggests that reactive melt percolation affected the Oman mantle at spinel-facies conditions, after melting and subsequent incorporation at lithospheric environment by conductive cooling. Such event, although not causing evident changes in mineral major element compositions, is clearly documented by modal and microstructural evolution of spinel harzburgites. This evolution reflects microscale variations in melt/rock ratios and indicates percolation of melts across the uppermost ~800m of mantle section, with no direct correlation with depth from the Moho Transition Zone.

Oceanic spreading is one of the core processes of modern plate tectonics. In oceanic spreading centers, the melts formed by asthenosphere decompression upwelling can migrate quickly into oceanic crust through focused channels (Xiong et al., 2022). However, the existed dunitic channel model is mainly built based on investigations of the Oman ophiolite produced in fast spreading centers. Researchers have few knowledges on how dunitic channels formed in slow-ultraslow spreading centers. In this study, we selected the Dazhuka ophiolite, a product formed in oceanic slow-ultraslow spreading centers (Wang et al., 2024), to reveal the formation mechanism of dunitic channels. Through detailed petrographic observations and geochemical analyses, we found that these dunites can be divided as three types, Type 1 dunite, Type 2 dunite and Type 3A/3B dunite. The three types of dunites have relationships in petrogenesis. 1) From Type 1 to Type 2 dunites, the content of orthopyroxene (Opx) is gradually decreasing until Opx is all consumed, while the diameter of olivine (Ol) is gradually growing up to 2-3 cm. In addition to this, geochemical evidence also shows gradually increasing of Mg#-whole rock (0.91-0.93), Cr#-spinel (Spl; 0.46-0.83) and LREE/HREE-clinopyroxene (Cpx, 0.08-1.42). These phenomena may indicate reaction between wall-rock harzburgites and silica-unsaturated melts. 2) From Type 2 to Type 3A/3B dunite, Mg#-whole rock (0.93-0.87), Cr#-Spl (0.83-0.24), and LREE/HREE-Cpx (1.42-0.02) are decreasing, which may be caused by interaction between Type 2 dunites and silica-saturation melts. 3) The three types of dunites all exhibit amphibole growing around Cpx, and enrichment of fluid mobile elements of two kinds of pyroxenes, implying that later volatile-rich melts or fluids metasomatized these dunites.

Based on these lines of evidence, we suggest that the formation processes of the multiple types of Dazhuka dunites reveal unique dynamic characteristics of asthenosphere upwelling beneath oceanic slow-ultraslow spreading centers. In the first stage, silica-unsaturated melts were formed by stronger asthenospheric upwelling and reacted with wall-rock harzburgites to gradually formed Type 1 and Type 2 dunites. In the second stage, the upwelling of asthenosphere with the dunitic channels became weaker, ambient silica-saturated melts were focused into the dunitic channels and reacted with Type 2 dunites to form Type 3A/3B dunites. Eventually, when the dunitic channels became a part of the lithospheric mantle, the asthenospheric upwelling almost stagnated and formed volatile-rich melts or fluids to metasomatize the dunitic channels within the lithosphere. This study thus shows that asthenospheric upwelling may be pulsed under oceanic slow-ultraslow spreading center.

Kimberlites give an exceptional insight of the deep cratonic mantle by exhuming at an extreme pace well-preserved peridotites from a wide range of depths. The fast exhumation velocity of peridotite limits diffusion of incompatible trace elements (REE, hydrogen) due to the interaction between the ascending kimberlite melt and the rock and allows to measure pristine water contents in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs). Water is regarded as a key parameter as it may impact, depending on its concentration, physical parameters such as rheology and partial melting. This study is focused on the petrology and water quantification of 17 spinel and garnet harzburgites scattered over a wide range of pressure (25 to 51 kbar) from Jagersfontein mine located at the rim of the Kaapvaal craton. Sampling was focused on poorly metasomatized, ultra-refractory harzburgites (Fo92-95) which are considered to represent the most preserved cratonic archean mantle. Water content was obtained from FTIR spectroscopy on the most representative phases: olivine, orthopyroxexe, clinopyroxene and garnet. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between petrology, water content of non-metasomatized cratonic mantle.

The observed nanochannels are found parallel to [001] along the clinopyroxene-amphibole interface, particularly where an even number of clinopyroxene I beams transform to an odd number of amphibole I beams (**Fig. 1**; Veblen and Buseck, 1981). All nanochannels have slightly asymmetrical, edge-like shape in the [010] direction from the clinopyroxene towards the amphibole, associated with an additional pyribole phase in the [100] direction towards the clinopyroxene (**Fig. 1**). The pyribole is most likely the result of stress relaxation finalizing the shapes of the nanochannels.

​      The major and trace element composition of rock-forming minerals of upper mantle xenoliths from the Persani Mountains volcanic area show that the upper mantle went through significant degree of hydrous metasomatism (Vaselli et al., 1995; Falus et al., 2008; Faccini et al., 2020; Lange et al., 2023). Fraction of the infiltrating H2O-bearing supercritical fluid was trapped in fluid inclusions hosted by olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene (Lange et al., 2023). In clinopyroxene, some fluid inclusions are associated with amphibole, which is the reaction product of the host clinopyroxene and the entrapped H2O-bearing fluid (Lange et al., 2023), based on petrographical observation. The presence of these channels implies higher diffusion velocity due to the relatively large "void" volume compared to other structural distortions along the clinopyroxene-amphibole phase boundary.

In our study, we use quantum mechanical simulations to explore the physical properties and effects of the clinopyroxene-amphibole interface that ensure the rapid element diffusion. The obtained results help us to better understand the formation and growth of nominally ‘water’-bearing minerals in deep lithospheric settings (lower crust, upper mantle) and the driving forces for significant fluid composition changes during micron- to nanoscale fluid evolution.

Stable isotope composition of CO2-rich fluid is a powerful tool to trace lithosphere scale fluid processes like Earth’s degassing and global carbon cycling. Fluid inclusions (FI) encapsulating CO2-rich fluids provide direct evidence on paleofluid migration events that took place at different levels of the deep lithosphere. On the other hand, deep fluid signature can also be detected in dissolved gases of much shallower-seated groundwaters, indicating the lithosphere scale connection of deep and shallow fluids. We present here preliminary results of the ongoing project ‘FluidsByDepth’, which aims to give contributions to the understanding of non-volcanic natural CO2 degassing in the central Pannonian Basin. A comparative study has been carried out by determining the carbon and noble gas composition of deep lithospheric fluid (entrapped as inclusion in mantle xenoliths) and melt inclusions of asthenospheric origin as well as shallow groundwater’s dissolved gases in the Bakony-Balaton Highland Volcanic Field, Styrian Basin Volcanic Field and the Persani Mountains Volcanic Field.  

A detailed characterization and thus careful selection of FI permitted the filtering out of late-stage fluid inclusions, which was also supported by the results on previous studies made on the same xenoliths in the sample series. In addition, vapor bubble of primary melt inclusions in olivine phenocrysts provided deep fluid signature from cooling alkali mafic melt. Moreover, groundwater was sampled considering the geohydrologic flow directions and hence was made at discharge areas. 

He, Ne, and Ar isotope compositions of FI were estimated by crushing technique, while carbon isotope composition of CO2 was approximated by Raman spectroscopy. One further goal of this study is to test the applicability to calculate δ^13^C-CO2 isotope compositions of fluids based on in situ Raman spectroscopic measurements. We applied this method on fluid inclusions in xenoliths, including harzburgite, lherzolite, websterite, mafic-, felsic and metapelitic granulites, which sampled both the upper mantle and the lower to upper crust. In total 129 individual FI were selected in different host minerals, such as clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, olivine, plagioclase and garnet. 

The δ^2^H and δ^18^O stable isotopic ratio of the sampled groundwaters indicate meteoric origin and show no sign of an additional deep basin (metamorphic, magmatic) contribution. In contrast, the δ13C isotopic ratio of the dissolved CO2 gases shows a narrow range (-5.2 – -9.6) and suggests mantle origin with slight organic sedimentary overprint. Stable isotopic ratios of dissolved helium also clearly indicate mantle origin for specific domains of the volcanic area.

Our results highlight the indirect role of preceding monogenetic upwelling channels as well as their relation to groundwater discharge areas in recent mantle degassing, which could be important contribution to deep carbon cycle.

Peridotite xenoliths from the Biyikali and Çorlu volcanic centers equilibrated at temperatures ranging from 757 to 1019 °C and pressures between 1.0 to 2.1 GPa (38–75 km).  The xenoliths record deformational microstructures consistent with transpressional shearing in a lithosphere-scale transcurrent fault system (Chatzaras et al., 2021).  Spinel displays oblate fabric ellipsoids, consistent with flattening strain.  Olivine exhibits axial-[010] and A-type crystallographic preferred orientation patterns (CPO).  The obliquity of olivine CPO to the spinel lineation decreases with proximity to the NAFZ, suggesting an increase in shear strain.

Analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that constituent phases retain some OH- but bulk rock concentrations are generally restricted to <50 ppm H2O by weight. From the rock microstructure, we determined differential stress magnitude and active deformation mechanism(s); combined with estimates of hydration state, we constrained the rheology.  Recrystallized grain size piezometry shows that the mantle beneath the NAFZ sustained differential stresses of 10 to 20 MPa, largely independent of depth.  The dominant deformation mechanism(s) change with depth; xenoliths extracted from shallower depths record evidence for grain size sensitive creep possibly in the presence of melt (Figure 1).  At intermediate depths, both dislocation creep and grain size sensitive mechanisms were active, and we did not observe evidence for deformation in the presence of melt.  The deepest samples were dominated by dislocation creep.  The strong temperature sensitivity of creep mechanisms, combined with the low variability in differential stress, contributes to a stratified viscosity profile ranging from 1018 Pa s for the deepest samples, to >1022 Pa s at shallower depths (assuming a melt-free rheology) (Lusk et al., 2023).  Although difficult to quantify from the rock record, melt likely reduced the viscosity of the shallow lithospheric mantle. The vertical stratification in viscosity below the NAFZ, the result of melt-present deformation and/or transitions in deformation mechanism, has important consequences for the seismic cycle of strike-slip fault systems.

We estimated the elastic wave velocities and seismic anisotropy of the peridotite xenoliths from the full elastic tensor, by accounting for the dependency of elasticity with pressure and temperature.  The spatial variations in the seismic properties with distance from the NAFZ and depth, provide insights into the effect of strain gradients and rheological stratification on the seismic structure of the lithospheric mantle beneath a transcurrent plate boundary.

We characterize and quantify the microstructure, hydrogen concentrations, and seismic properties of a tectonically exhumed – very fresh – sliver of oceanic lithospheric mantle outcropping in the Moa Island (Leti archipelago, Timor-Tanimbar region). The 18 studied spinel peridotites (lherzolites and harzburgites) display variable degrees of olivine recrystallization (6.9-31.3 %), recorded by growth of strain‐free neoblasts onto the pre-existing deformed (coarse-porphyroclastic) microstructure. Occurrence of clinopyroxenes with interstitial (cuspate) shapes and crystal‐preferred orientations (CPOs) uncorrelated with the olivine CPO implies post-deformation crystallization by reactive melt percolation.

The olivine CPO has dominantly axial‐[010] or \[100](010) patterns, similar to those usually observed in peridotitic xenoliths from oceanic mantle lithosphere. Seismic properties are calculated based on the modal compositions and CPO data for all samples. Increase in the olivine recrystallized fraction decreased the seismic anisotropy, since dynamic recrystallization produced some dispersion of the CPO but did not change the pattern acquired during the asthenospheric deformation. Average seismic velocities (mean Vp=7.9 km.s-1; mean Vs=4.5 km.s-1) and anisotropy (mean maximum S wave polarization anisotropy = 4.5%) are estimated by considering coherent orientation of the foliation and lineation of all samples. 

The nominally anhydrous minerals contain small amounts of hydrogen (olivine: 18 ppm H2O by weight; orthopyroxene: 58-175 ppm (Figure 1) H2O wt and clinopyroxenes: 244-288 ppm H2O wt), which yields an average bulk water content of 50 ppm H2O wt for the Moa spinel-bearing peridotites, in agreement with previous estimates for the oceanic mantle lithosphere based on peridotitic xenoliths (Figure 1). This is the first direct measurement of the hydrogen concentrations in peridotites from an oceanic mantle lithosphere not modified by extensive serpentinization or magmatic extraction. As previously reported, no correlation between CPO patterns and hydrogen concentrations is found.

Magma-poor ocean-continent transition zones (OCTs) encompass extensive regions of tectonically uplifted mantle. While substantial literature has explored fossil analogues (e.g., Picazo et al., 2016), recent studies on mantle sequences exhumed in modern OCTs are limited (e.g., McCarthy et al., 2020), resulting in a fragmented understanding. Key questions regarding the mechanisms, timing, and location of lithospheric breakup, melt production, and the nature of the mantle source remain debated.

The West Iberian margin (WIM) is one the best-documented continental margins worldwide, with scientific drilling initiated more than three decades ago (e.g., Boillot et al., 1989). However, peridotites from this region have remained poorly characterized due to their extensive serpentinization.

In this study, we revisit the peridotites from the OCT of the WIM, presenting new in situ data for a set of variably serpentinized samples. To capture a comprehensive view of the petrological and geochemical characteristics, we analyzed samples from three boreholes along an E-W transect, from the most proximal to the most oceanward domains: ODP Hole 1068A, 899B, and 1070A. 

Hole 1068A samples are serpentinized plagioclase lherzolites (cpx ~ 10 vol.%) with Na2O- (0.61-0.87 wt%) and Al2O3-rich (5.83-7.10 wt%) clinopyroxene, high spinel Cr# (0.255-0.322) and TiO2 (0.21-0.30 wt%). These characteristics, along with clinopyroxene convex-upward REE patterns yielding negative Eu anomalies and high YbN= 15-17, resemble those of refertilized domains in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM, e.g. Müntener et al., 2010). Geochemical modelling indicates an origin involving MORB-type melt impregnation followed by re-equilibration in the plagioclase stability field.

Hole 899B exhibits the higher degree of lithological and chemical heterogeneity. The investigated rock-types are coarse-grained peridotites, varying from spinel to plagioclase harzburgites (cpx ~ 2-8 vol.%). They show evidence of melt-rock interaction, highlighted by olivine-forming, pyroxene-dissolving microstructures. Plagioclase ± secondary orthopyroxene aggregates were also observed in sample 899-1. Mineral compositions (i.e. clinopyroxene and spinel) have moderately depleted to slightly enriched signatures (Cpx: Al2O3= 4.05-6.90 wt%, Na2O= 0.23-0.63 wt%; Sp: Cr#= 0.230-0.463, TiO2= 0.58-0.61 wt% for sample 899-1). Clinopyroxene in spinel harzburgites displays uncommon chondrite-normalized V-shaped REE patterns (LaN/SmN= 2.7-3.4, DyN/YbN= 0.5-0.6) previously recorded in mantle xenoliths from central and eastern Europe (e.g. Downes et al., 2003). In contrast, clinopyroxene in plagioclase-bearing sample shows concave-downward REE patterns, with depleted LREE segments (LaN/SmN= 0.02-0.03) and negative Eu anomalies, suggesting melt depletion followed by re-equilibration in the plagioclase stability field.

Hole 1070A peridotites are coarse-grained spinel harzburgites (cpx ~ 2-5 vol.%) displaying pyroxene-dissolving and olivine-precipitating microtextures. Positive correlations among melting indexes in clinopyroxene (i.e. Cr#, Al2O3 and Yb) suggest a residual origin for these lithologies. However, unusual Cr-Na enrichments and hump-shaped clinopyroxene REE patterns indicate open system melting in the spinel stability field, accompanied by percolation of an enriched melt. These features, though rare in modern oceans, were previously attested in some peridotites from slow- to ultraslow-spreading settings (Hellebrand & Snow, 2003; Seyler et al., 2011).

Calculated equilibrium temperatures for the WIM peridotites range within those of fossil OCTs (T~Ca-in-Opx~= 921-1029 °C). They reflect a history of melt-rock interaction at high temperature (T~REE-Y~= 1098-1244 °C), followed by thermal re-equilibration at lower temperatures (T~Ol-Sp~= 770-813 °C).

These new data provide compelling evidence of highly heterogeneous mantle domains exposed in the OCT of the WIM. The documented heterogeneity, observed among peridotites from the same borehole and among boreholes, challenges the traditional view of OCTs as regions with simple and fixed distribution of mantle domains with well-defined major and trace element compositions. We posit that melt-rock interaction plays a key role in generating petrological and chemical heterogeneity in OCTs and the upper mantle.

The Dinaride ophiolite belt connects the Alpine peridotite bodies with those of Albania and Greece. The belt consists of numerous individual massifs and smaller outcrops. The Krivaja-Konjuh massif in central Bosnia is one of the largest peridotite complexes within the Dinarides with an area of 650 km2. The massif is embedded in a limestone melange, with structural similarities to an ocean-continent transitional setting documented for some Alpine peridotite bodies.

The lithology of the western part of the massif (Krivaja) ranges from spinel peridotites in the south and west to predominantly plagioclase peridotites in the north and east, with a central portion consisting of plagioclase dunites grading into troctolites and gabbros. The plagioclase peridotites record both melt migration/impregnation and metamorphic reaction of spinel to plagioclase.

Major and minor element compositions as well as phase proportions indicate that the Krivaja massif is fertile, with olivine phase proportions from 50 to 70\%, and clinopyroxene (cpx) Na$_2$O up to 2\% at 6 - 7\% Al$_2$O$_3$. No macroscopic (matrix) hydrous phases have been observed.

Newly acquired trace element data confirm the generally fertile nature of the massif. Trace element patterns suggest typical degrees of melt extraction of at most a few percent. Significantly, the data show that the spinel peridotites have not been refertilized after melt extraction; or metasomatized by a hydrous fluid. Some samples from the southwestern-most portion of the massif have cpx trace element patterns/contents virtually identical to the model MORB source composition DMM (Workman and Hart, 2005).

Both opx and cpx porphyroclasts have extensive exsolution lamellae indicating adjustment to lower pressures and temperatures. Porphyroclast rims and neoblasts are free of exsolution. While most of the exsolution lamellae consist of the opposite species of pyroxene, the lamellae also contain small grains of spinel and pargasitic amphibole. Both are consistent with adjustment of the pyroxene composition down temperature and pressure where the solubility of Al$_2$O$_3$ and H$_2$O as well as other trace elements decreases. The trace element patterns exclude a metasomatic origin of the amphibole. The presence of amphibole therefore indicates a significant hydroxyl content of the protolith, consistent with the overall fertility of the massif.

Two-pyroxene thermometry of porphyroclasts was based on area analyses that sought to integrate the exsolution lamellae. The so obtained temperatures range up to 1300$^{\circ}$C. For neoblasts the lowest calculated temperatures of some of the most deformed samples record temperatures near 900$^{\circ}$C. Comparing compositions of porphyroclasts and neoblasts as a function of temperature indicates equilibration of neoblast MgO contents to the lower temperature, but not for example their Na$_2$O content.

The high Na$_2$O content of cpx, the occurrence of symplectites of opx and spinel after garnet together with the high temperatures suggest parts of the massif originated near the spinel to garnet transition at the base of the lithosphere. The fertile nature of the massif with near MORB source trace element composition includes a corresponding hydroxyl content. This water content affects diffusion and deformation, discussed in Part 2. Overall the massif enables observation of processes associated with rift initiation in a fertile environment.

The spinel peridotites throughout the Krivaja massif, Central Bosnia, show signs of deformation by dislocation creep. However, the microstructures generally do not correspond well to the definition of a porphyroclastic texture. The grain shapes particularly of neoblasts are irregular and embayed, rather than polygonal. The largest porphyroclasts suggest pre-deformation grain sizes near 1 cm. Cpx grains in more highly deformed samples form in some cases continuous recrystallization trails extending across thin sections. Some opx porphyroclasts show similar elongation. In some instances olivine remains porphyroclastic. The most highly deformed samples can be characterized as mylonytic/ultramylonitic with grain sizes near 50 micron. 

Extensive phase mixing is observable in olivine dominated areas, while phase mixing in recrystallizing cpx trails and directly adjacent to opx porphyroclasts is more limited. Analysis of the phase distribution following Heilbronner and Barrett (2014) indicates that the phase distribution particularly of the most fine-grained aggregates falls into the (chess board-like) ’ordered’ domain, interpreted to originate by a solution-precipitation process. Large strain deformation experiments with olivine and opx resulted in similarly ordered aggregates (Tasaka et al., 2017). They attributed the phase mixing to stress-driven diffusive redistribution of Mg and Fe. Consistent with this notion neoblasts show diffusive equilibration of Mg and Fe down temperature (Part 1).

Most samples have a well-developed, predominantly E-type fabrics. In some samples porphyroclasts have an E-type fabric, while neoblasts have an A-type fabric. The most highly deformed (and mixed) samples have only weak fabrics. As detailed in Part 1, the presence of exsolved amphibole indicates moderate hydroxyl contents of the mineral phases prior to exsolution. Experimentally, E-type (or axial \[100](001)) fabrics have been observed in deformation of olivine with moderate water contents (Jung et al., 2006).  A transition from E-type fabric to fabrics with neoblast A-type may develop due to exsolution of amphibole and consequent partitioning of hydrogen into amphibole at decreasing temperature (Part 1). The weak fabrics of the most highly deformed and mixed samples are consistent with a diffusive deformation mechanism.

The observations indicate that phase mixing based on diffusion can occur at deep lithospheric levels. Diffusion of Mg and Fe can be enhanced by the presence of hydrogen in fertile compositions (see Part 1). The mixed lithologies retard grain growth, and deform predominantly by diffusion creep. This provides a mechanism for strain localization during rift initiation in fertile mantle.

We hypothesize that the massif records rift initiation in MORB source mantle, with deformation starting at high temperatures near the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Deformation continues at decreasing temperature and pressure during lithospheric thinning. The consequent mantle upwelling leads to melting and melt migration observable in the central and north-eastern parts of the massif in the form of interstitial plagioclase in finger-like domains. The microstructures of plagioclase bearing peridotites show no further sign of deformation and indicate recovery. Troctolites and gabbros together with minor pillow basalts and cherts indicate the formation of an incipient ocean basin.

From the Early Devonian to the Carboniferous, the convergence between Gondwana and Laurussia led to the assembly of Pangea during the Variscan Orogeny. This orogen can be followed through Europe along the Bohemian, Armorican, French Massif Central and Iberian massifs. In the latter, the most internal zone of the orogen appears in several allochthonous complexes that contains, from bottom to top, a Late Devonian high-P and low- to intermediate-T metamorphic belt (Lower Allochthon), Cambrian and Middle Devonian ophiolitic units and an Upper Allochthon whose lower section constitutes an Early Devonian high-P and high-T metamorphic belt (Arenas et al., 2016). This metamorphic belt is constituted by ultramafic massifs, high-P granulites, eclogites, and high-P migmatitic paragneisses. The eclogites occur in boudins within the gneisses and in a 20 km long and 700 m thick layer constituting one of the largest outcrops of eclogites worldwide. In this layer, Mendia et al. (2001) distinguished three types of eclogites: common eclogites, ferrotitaniferous eclogites and kyanite-bearing eclogites (Figure 1). In this work, we have studied the three types of eclogites via thermodynamic modelling. The calculations yield metamorphic peak conditions of ~ 750-800 ºC and 23-25 kbar that indicate deep subduction of the peri-Gondwanan realm at the onset of the Variscan Orogeny (c. 400 Ma), when the eclogites were buried up to ~ 90 km depth.

Since the discovery of Oceanic Core Complexes (OCC) at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, numerous structures of similar nature have been recognized worldwide (e.g., Whitney et al. 2013). Some of the first OCC identified in ophiolitic complexes were Puke and Krabbi massifs in the Mirdita Ophiolite, Albania (Nicolas et al. 1999). An advantage of the Mirdita complex is its undisturbed, oceanic tectonics allowing studies of primary contacts and spatial relationships between lithologies. This study focuses on microtextural and geochemical features of Puke peridotites and related rocks to reconstruct its primary characteristic and exhumation conditions.

The primary lithology of Puke is a coarse-grained, anhydrous spinel harzburgite, which currently outcrops only in its eastern section (Fig. 1a). The olivine is partially recrystallized, displaying polygonal shapes. Crystallographic Preferred Orientations (CPO) of olivine are well-defined (J index>2.5). Textures of harzburgites record high temperature deformation, compatible with asthenospheric flow conditions.

The dominant lithology in the Puke massif is, however, plagioclase-bearing lherzolitic mylonite, which grade into ultramylonites in the western part of the massif. Plagioclase occurs in all mylonites in various proportions, forming trails, continous layers, or being part of aggregates. Amphibole occurs only in some sections of the massif. Pyroxenes are present as porphyroclasts and also as interstitial grains organised in trails or laminae, or forming pyroxene±olivine aggregates. Porphyroclasts often exhibit corroded rims, especially when surrounded by fine-grained aggregates. Olivine CPO weakens from the mylonites to the ultramylonites towards the west (J index decreasing from 2.18 to 1.05). In all peridotites serpentinization postdates deformation. Ubiquitous gabbroic and pyroxenitic veins are up to 10 or more cm thick and are concordant with the host peridotite’s foliations.

Differences between coarse-grained harzburgites and mylonites are also clearly visible in mineral chemistry. Olivine is Fo-richer in harzburgites compared to mylonites (90.5-91 vs. 86-90.5, respectively). Spinel and pyroxenes are TiO2-poor in harzburgites and TiO2-rich in mylonites (<0.1 and 0.1-1.9 wt.% in spinel and <0.2 and 0.2-1.1 wt.% in clinopyroxene, respectively). The pyroxenes in harzburgites are HREE-poor (LuN<0.4 in orthopyroxene and <1.1 in clinopyroxene) compared to pyroxenes in mylonites (LuN>0.8 in orthopyroxene and LuN <1.1 in clinopyroxene; Fig. 1 b). Plagioclase is present only in mylonites and shows  a wide range of An contents reaching very high values (75-95 %). Interestingly, chemical composition of the flaser gabbros caping peridotites and concordant gabbro veins in the peridotites perfectly mimics trace elements contents in pyroxenes and anorthite in plagioclase for mylonites.

Early works considered Puke as a plagioclase lherzolite massif, but detailed structural investigations recognized the secondary nature of plagioclase related to melt percolation and widespread mylonitization (Nicolas et al. 1999). The presented structural and geochemical data confirms the impregnative character of the Puke massif. Harzburgites evolved in spinel facies conditions and experienced high melt extraction degree, but were later affected by mineralogical and chemical enrichment by percolating melts. This magmatic event was syn-deformational, and magmatic impregnation blurred the primary fabrics of the harzburgites. The percolating melt had characteristics similar to MORB with various content of water as suggested by changes in modal content of impregnative amphibole, and by the high anorthite content of plagioclase. The intensity of deformation increases westward, and transition from coarse-grained harzburgites to more fertile mylonites is gradational. The presented structural and chemical data is in agreement with the scenario of OCC formation proposed by Nicolas et al. (2017). As our results show lithological similarities with the Othris massif in Greece (Dijkstra et al. 2001), we suggest that similar processes may have shaped lithological mantle in other sectors of the Pindos-Mirdita Ocean.

Mélange channels are a noteworthy feature of subduction zones as they are variable in composition and control elemental mass fluxes (e.g., carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc.) thus contributing to diversity of arc magmas and heterogeneity of the mantle. Constraining the phase equilibria of sediment-rich mélanges is necessary to understand the role of subducted sediments in deep volatile cycling and in mass transfer to arc lava sources. While pure sedimentary subducted lithologies has been previously explored, the phase equilibria of the full spectrum of compositional variety for subducted mélanges has yet to be constrained. 

Here, we investigate the phase equilibria of a sediment-rich mélange (~60 wt. % SiO2, volatile-free) in a mixture consisting of 90% sedimentary composition (mud-shale) analogous to the Franciscan complex in San Simeon, USA mixed with 10% of an ultramafic-rich mélange (serpentinite and chlorite schists) from the Kampos Belt in Syros, Greece at fore-arc to sub-arc depths (2-3GPa, 700-1150°C) and at 5 and 10 wt. % bulk water contents using piston cylinder apparatus.

Partial melting of subducted hydrous-shaley rich matrix yields hydrous dacitic to rhyolitic melts (64-79 wt.% SiO2 volatile-free, Mg# 32-55) coexisting with orthopyroxene, amphibole, mica, quartz, and garnet. The solidus at 5 wt.% H2O is just below 700°C at 2GPa and at 800°C at 3GPa. For 10 wt. % H2O and at both 2 and 3GPa, the solidus is just below 700°C. Hydrous minerals such as amphiboles and K-micas are stable up to 1000°C and 800°C at 2GPa and 1000°C and 900°C at 3GPa, respectively. In contrast to purely sediment mélanges (~76 wt. % SiO2 starting, volatile-free) melting under the same conditions (2GPa and 1000°C), our slightly mafic mélange yields alkali-depleted melt, with 2x less Na2O and K2O and 3-4x more enriched in MgO and FeO. Such melt compositions are in the range of ~15% of global natural arc lavas for wt. % SiO2 (volatile-free).

The results of our experimental study demonstrate there are volatile-hosting minerals (micas, amphiboles) in the mélange channel of the subducting slab as well as in the residues of partial melting of the mélange in the sub-arc mantle in intermediate to hot subduction zones. This indicates the potential for deep cycling of volatiles during subduction of shale-rich mélanges. Furthermore, the partial melts from such shale-rich mélanges act as metasomatic agents by creating pyroxenitic bodies during partial melting, furthering mantle heterogeneity (Rebaza et al, 2023). Lastly, within the compositional range of existing natural arc lavas, subducted sediment-rich mélanges yield silica-rich melts, which if erupted nearly unchanged through pyroxenitic channels[1], diversify primary arc magma chemistries.
